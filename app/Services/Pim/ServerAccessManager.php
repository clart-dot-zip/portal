// Deprecated legacy class intentionally left empty. The new PIM architecture no longer
// communicates with remote servers for group management. This stub remains only to
// avoid breaking autoloaders during in-progress refactors. Please remove any lingering
// references to ServerAccessManager before deleting this file.
// Pending removal once legacy references are gone.
